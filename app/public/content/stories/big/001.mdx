I was <u>digging</u> deep in my mine <u>looking</u> for gold. The cave was dark so I had my light with me. I had been <u>working</u> for a long time and was <u>getting</u> tired. Then I saw it - a big gold rock in the wall!

I was so <u>excited</u> that I <u>started</u> <u>hitting</u> the rock with my pick. The gold came out in big chunks. I put it all in my bag and felt very happy. This was the <u>biggest</u> find I had ever made in my mine.

<u>After</u> I got all the gold, I went back to my house. I was <u>thinking</u> about what to do with it. I could make gold tools or trade it for other <u>useful</u> things. The gold was very heavy in my bag.

At my house, I put the gold in a safe box. I was <u>feeling</u> proud of my hard work. <u>Tomorrow</u> I would go back to the mine to look for more. <u>Mining</u> was hard work but it was fun too. I could not wait to tell my <u>friends</u> about my big find!
