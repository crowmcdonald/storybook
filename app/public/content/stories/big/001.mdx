They had to wait in a long line. Tom's mom had their <u>tickets</u> ready. The lady at the desk was <u>helpful</u>. She gave them their <u>boarding</u> passes. Tom was <u>excited</u> to fly on the plane.

While they waited, Tom saw many <u>different</u> things. There were shops that sold <u>magazines</u> and snacks. He saw a man with a <u>laptop</u> working at a table. A little girl was playing with her <u>brother</u> near the gate.

When it was time to board, Tom felt <u>nervous</u> but happy. He had never been on a plane <u>before</u>. His mom held his hand as they walked down the <u>jetway</u>. This was going to be an <u>adventure</u> he would <u>always</u> <u>remember</u>!
