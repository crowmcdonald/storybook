I was <u>planning</u> to build the <u>biggest</u> house in my world. I had been <u>thinking</u> about it for days. The house would have many rooms and a tall tower. I was <u>excited</u> to start <u>building</u> it.

First, I went <u>cutting</u> down trees to get wood. I was <u>chopping</u> all day until I had a big pile. The wood would be good for the walls and roof. I also got rock from the mine to make it strong.

I <u>started</u> <u>building</u> the base with rock. Then I put up <u>wooden</u> walls that were very tall. I made big <u>windows</u> so light could come in. The house was <u>looking</u> great and I was proud of my work.

<u>After</u> many days of <u>building</u>, my house was done. It was the most <u>beautiful</u> house I had ever made. I had a big room for <u>sleeping</u> and one for <u>cooking</u>. There was even a room for all my tools. My new house was <u>perfect</u> and I loved <u>living</u> in it!
