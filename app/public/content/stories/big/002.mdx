It was Emma's <u>birthday</u> and she woke up early. She ran <u>downstairs</u> to see if there were any <u>presents</u>. The house was quiet. She felt a little sad that <u>nobody</u> was awake yet.

Then she heard a sound from the <u>kitchen</u>. She walked in and saw her whole <u>family</u> there! "<u>Surprise</u>!" they all yelled. Her mom had made <u>pancakes</u> in the shape of hearts. Her dad was holding a big <u>balloon</u>.

Her <u>brother</u> gave her a <u>special</u> gift. It was a new book about <u>animals</u>. Her <u>sister</u> had made her a <u>bracelet</u> with <u>colorful</u> beads. Emma felt so happy and loved.

After <u>breakfast</u>, they all went to the park <u>together</u>. They played games and had a <u>picnic</u>. Emma thought this was the best <u>birthday</u> ever. She would <u>remember</u> this <u>wonderful</u> day <u>forever</u>.
