When night came, I was <u>getting</u> ready for a big fight. The bad mobs would be <u>coming</u> out soon. I had my best sword and my armor on. I was <u>feeling</u> brave and ready to fight them all.

The first mob I saw was a big green one. It was <u>walking</u> slow near my house. I ran at it with my sword and <u>started</u> <u>hitting</u> it hard. The mob made a bad sound and ran away from me.

Then more mobs came from the dark woods. I was <u>jumping</u> and <u>fighting</u> them one by one. My sword was very sharp and cut them fast. I was <u>winning</u> the fight and felt very proud of my skills.

<u>After</u> the fight was over, the sun <u>started</u> to come up. All the bad mobs were gone and I was safe. I had won the <u>biggest</u> fight of my life! I went back to my house <u>feeling</u> like a real hero. I could not wait to tell my <u>friends</u> about my big win!
