Sam looked <u>outside</u> his <u>window</u>. The rain was falling hard. He could not go out to play. He felt <u>disappointed</u>. What could he do <u>inside</u> all day?

His mom had an idea. "Let's make <u>something</u> <u>together</u>," she said. They went to get <u>supplies</u> from the <u>closet</u>. They found paper, glue, <u>scissors</u>, and <u>markers</u>. Sam was <u>curious</u> about what they would make.

They <u>decided</u> to make a <u>scrapbook</u> of their <u>family</u> trips. Sam found <u>pictures</u> from their beach <u>vacation</u>. His mom had photos from their visit to <u>grandma</u>'s house. They <u>arranged</u> them on the pages.

By the time they <u>finished</u>, the rain had stopped. But Sam didn't even <u>notice</u>. He was having too much fun! He learned that <u>sometimes</u> rainy days can be the most <u>creative</u> days of all.
