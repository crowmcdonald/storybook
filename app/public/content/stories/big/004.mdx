Superman was <u>flying</u> over the city when he saw a big fire. The fire was <u>burning</u> a tall building and people were in it. He knew he had to help them fast. Superman was the only one who could save them all.

He flew down to the building and <u>started</u> <u>helping</u> people get out. Superman was <u>lifting</u> them one by one and <u>flying</u> them to safety. The people were very scared but felt better when they saw him.

The fire was <u>getting</u> <u>bigger</u> and hotter. Superman used his cold breath to blow on the fire. The flames <u>started</u> <u>getting</u> <u>smaller</u> and <u>smaller</u>. He kept <u>blowing</u> until the fire was all gone.

<u>After</u> the fire was out, all the people said thank you to Superman. He was <u>feeling</u> happy that he could help them. The city was safe again and Superman flew away. He was always ready to help when people needed him most!
