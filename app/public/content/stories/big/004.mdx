Maya loved to help her <u>grandfather</u> in his <u>garden</u>. Every <u>Saturday</u>, she would visit him. He had the most <u>beautiful</u> <u>flowers</u> and <u>vegetables</u> in the <u>neighborhood</u>.

One day, her <u>grandfather</u> taught her how to plant <u>tomatoes</u>. He showed her how to make small holes in the soil. Maya <u>carefully</u> placed each tiny plant in its new home. She felt <u>important</u> doing this <u>special</u> job.

They also <u>watered</u> the <u>carrots</u> and <u>lettuce</u>. Maya's <u>favorite</u> part was picking the ripe <u>strawberries</u>. They were sweet and juicy. Her <u>grandfather</u> let her take some home in a <u>basket</u>.

As they worked <u>together</u>, he told her <u>stories</u> about when he was young. Maya loved these <u>moments</u> with him. She was <u>learning</u> so much about plants and about her <u>family</u> <u>history</u> too.
