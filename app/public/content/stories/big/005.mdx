Mrs. Johnson lived next door to Ben's <u>family</u>. She was <u>elderly</u> and lived alone. One day, Ben <u>noticed</u> she was having <u>trouble</u> <u>carrying</u> her <u>groceries</u> from the car.

Ben ran over to help. "<u>Thank</u> you," Mrs. Johnson said with a <u>grateful</u> smile. Ben <u>carried</u> the bags <u>inside</u> for her. She <u>offered</u> him some <u>cookies</u> she had just baked.

From that day on, Ben <u>visited</u> Mrs. Johnson often. He would help her with small <u>chores</u> around the house. She would tell him <u>wonderful</u> <u>stories</u> about her <u>childhood</u>. They became good friends.

Ben's <u>parents</u> were proud of him for being so <u>thoughtful</u>. They said being a good <u>neighbor</u> was <u>important</u>. Ben felt happy <u>knowing</u> he was making a <u>difference</u> in <u>someone</u>'s life. <u>Sometimes</u> the <u>smallest</u> acts of <u>kindness</u> mean the most.
