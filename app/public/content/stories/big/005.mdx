A big storm hit the farm and broke many things. The <u>farmer</u> was very sad <u>looking</u> at his broken barn. His animals had no place to stay warm and dry. He did not know how to fix it all by himself.

Superman was <u>flying</u> by and saw the broken farm. He came down to talk to the <u>farmer</u>. The <u>farmer</u> told him about the storm and how it broke his barn. Superman said he would help fix it all.

Superman <u>started</u> <u>lifting</u> the heavy wood and putting it back up. He was very strong and could move big beams by himself. The <u>farmer</u> was <u>helping</u> by <u>holding</u> the wood in place. They worked <u>together</u> all day.

When they were done, the barn looked even <u>better</u> than before. The animals were happy to have their warm home back. The <u>farmer</u> <u>thanked</u> Superman for all his help. Superman was glad he could help the farm <u>family</u> get back on their feet!
