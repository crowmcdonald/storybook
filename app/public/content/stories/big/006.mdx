Superman saw a train <u>going</u> too fast down the hill. The train could not stop and was <u>heading</u> for the city. There were many people on the train and they were all scared. Superman knew he had to stop the train fast.

He flew in front of the train and put his hands out. The train was very heavy but Superman was strong. He was <u>pushing</u> back hard to slow it down. The train <u>started</u> <u>going</u> <u>slower</u> and <u>slower</u>.

The people on the train could see Superman <u>helping</u> them. They were not scared anymore. Superman kept <u>pushing</u> until the train came to a full stop. All the people were safe and sound.

The train <u>driver</u> <u>thanked</u> Superman for <u>saving</u> them all. Superman was happy that no one got hurt. He flew away <u>knowing</u> that the city was safe again. Superman always made sure people were safe from harm!
