I was <u>planning</u> to build the <u>biggest</u> Lego city ever. I had many boxes of Lego blocks and was <u>excited</u> to start. I was <u>thinking</u> about <u>making</u> tall buildings and roads. This would be my best Lego work yet.

First, I <u>started</u> <u>building</u> the roads with gray blocks. I made them go all over my room. Then I <u>started</u> <u>making</u> houses with red and blue blocks. Each house was <u>different</u> and had its own style.

I was <u>working</u> on my city for many days. I made a school, a shop, and even a park. I put small Lego people in the city to live there. The city was <u>looking</u> great and I was proud of my work.

When my city was done, I showed it to my mom and dad. They said it was the most <u>beautiful</u> Lego city they had ever seen. I was so happy with my <u>building</u> work. I could not wait to build more things with my Lego blocks!
