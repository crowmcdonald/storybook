I was <u>building</u> a big robot out of Lego blocks. The robot was going to be my <u>helper</u> around the house. I was <u>making</u> it tall with long arms and big hands. The robot would be able to help me with many jobs.

I was <u>working</u> on the robot for hours. I put wheels on the bottom so it could move around. I made a face for it with lights that could turn on and off. The robot was <u>looking</u> very cool and smart.

When the robot was done, I tried to make it move. I put a small motor inside and it <u>started</u> <u>walking</u> around my room. The robot could pick up my toys and put them away. It was like having a real <u>helper</u>!

My <u>friends</u> came over to see my Lego robot. They all said it was the best robot they had ever seen. I was <u>feeling</u> very proud of my <u>building</u> skills. <u>Making</u> things with Lego was my <u>favorite</u> thing to do!
