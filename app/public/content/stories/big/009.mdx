I had a plan to build the most amazing Lego castle. I had been <u>thinking</u> about it for weeks. The castle would have tall towers and thick walls. I was <u>excited</u> to start <u>building</u> this big project.

I <u>started</u> with the base and made it very wide. Then I was <u>building</u> up the walls with gray Lego blocks. I made four towers at each corner of the castle. Each tower was tall and had a flag on top.

I was <u>adding</u> a big gate to the front of the castle. I also made a bridge that could move up and down. Inside the castle, I built rooms for the king and queen. I put Lego people inside to live there.

When my castle was done, it was the <u>biggest</u> thing I had ever built. My whole <u>family</u> came to see it and said it was great. I was so proud of my <u>building</u> work. This castle would be in my room for a long time!
