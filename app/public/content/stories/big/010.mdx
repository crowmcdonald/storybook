Spider-Man was <u>swinging</u> fast from building to building in the city. He was <u>using</u> his webs to move from place to place. Spider-Man was <u>looking</u> for bad guys who needed to be stopped. <u>Swinging</u> was the <u>fastest</u> way to get around the city.

He saw some bad guys <u>trying</u> to rob a bank. Spider-Man shot his web at the building and swung down fast. He was <u>ready</u> to stop the bad guys from <u>taking</u> the money. His webs were very strong and could hold him up.

Spider-Man <u>started</u> <u>fighting</u> the bad guys with his webs. He shot webs at them to tie them up. The bad guys could not move when they were stuck in the webs. Spider-Man was <u>winning</u> the fight with his web power.

<u>After</u> the fight, the police came to take the bad guys away. Spider-Man had saved the bank and all the money. He shot a web up high and swung away. The city was safe again <u>thanks</u> to Spider-Man and his amazing webs!
