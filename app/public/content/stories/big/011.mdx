Spider-Man got a call that there was trouble at the school. A big tree had fallen and was <u>blocking</u> the door. All the kids were stuck inside and could not get out. Spider-Man knew he had to help them fast.

He swung to the school and saw the big tree. The tree was too heavy for most people to move. But Spider-Man was very strong and had his webs to help. He tied his webs around the tree to <u>lift</u> it up.

Spider-Man was <u>pulling</u> hard on his webs to move the tree. It was heavy but he was strong. <u>Slowly</u> the tree <u>started</u> to move away from the door. The kids inside could hear him <u>working</u> to help them.

When the tree was moved, all the kids came out of the school. They were so happy to see Spider-Man had saved them. <u>Thanks</u> to Spider-Man, the kids could go home to their <u>families</u>. Spider-Man felt good <u>helping</u> the kids at school!
