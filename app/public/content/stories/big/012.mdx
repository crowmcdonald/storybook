Spider-Man heard a girl <u>crying</u> in the park. Her cat was stuck high up in a tree and could not get down. The girl was very sad and did not know what to do. Spider-Man said he would help get the cat down.

Spider-Man shot his web up to the tree where the cat was <u>sitting</u>. He climbed up his web to reach the cat. The cat was scared but Spider-Man was very gentle with it. He picked up the cat and held it close.

Then Spider-Man used his web to swing down from the tree. He was <u>holding</u> the cat safe in his arms. The cat was not scared anymore because Spider-Man was <u>keeping</u> it safe. They came down slow and soft.

When they got to the ground, Spider-Man gave the cat back to the girl. She was so happy to have her cat back! She <u>thanked</u> Spider-Man for <u>helping</u> her and her pet. Spider-Man was glad he could help the girl and her cat get back <u>together</u>!
