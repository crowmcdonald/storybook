I was <u>excited</u> to play my first Roblox game. I had heard my <u>friends</u> talk about it at school. I made my avatar look cool with a red hat and blue shirt. I was ready to start <u>playing</u> and have fun.

The first game I tried was about <u>building</u> a house. I was <u>putting</u> blocks <u>together</u> to make walls and a roof. Other <u>players</u> were <u>building</u> too and we could see each other's work. <u>Building</u> in Roblox was very fun and easy.

Then I tried a racing game where I could drive a fast car. I was <u>driving</u> around a track with other <u>players</u>. My car was red and could go very fast. I was <u>trying</u> to win the race and beat all the other cars.

<u>After</u> <u>playing</u> for hours, I loved Roblox so much. There were so many games to try and <u>friends</u> to play with. I could not wait to play again and try new games. Roblox was the best game I had ever played!
