I was <u>playing</u> a hide and seek game in Roblox with my <u>friends</u>. One person had to find all the other <u>players</u> who were <u>hiding</u>. I was <u>trying</u> to find the best place to hide so I would not get found.

I found a good spot behind a big tree. I was <u>sitting</u> very still and quiet. The person who was seeking was <u>walking</u> around <u>looking</u> for us. I could see them <u>getting</u> close to my <u>hiding</u> spot.

Then the seeker walked right past me! They did not see me behind the tree. I was so happy that my <u>hiding</u> spot worked. Other <u>players</u> were not so lucky and got found. I was one of the last ones <u>hiding</u>.

When the game was over, I had won! I was the best at <u>hiding</u> and did not get found. My <u>friends</u> said I picked a great spot. We played many more games and had lots of fun <u>together</u> in Roblox!
