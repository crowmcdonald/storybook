I was <u>playing</u> Roblox and met a nice <u>player</u> named Sam. We were both <u>building</u> houses in the same game. Sam was <u>helping</u> me learn how to make my house look better. We became good <u>friends</u> very fast.

Sam showed me how to use <u>different</u> blocks and colors. We were <u>working</u> <u>together</u> to build a big city. Sam was very good at <u>building</u> and taught me many new things. <u>Playing</u> with <u>friends</u> was much more fun than <u>playing</u> alone.

We also tried other games <u>together</u>. We played racing games and <u>jumping</u> games. Sam and I made a good <u>team</u> and helped each other win. We had so much fun <u>playing</u> all the <u>different</u> games.

Now Sam and I play Roblox <u>together</u> every day. We are best <u>friends</u> in the game and in real life too. <u>Making</u> <u>friends</u> in Roblox was one of the best things about the game. I love <u>playing</u> with my new friend Sam!
