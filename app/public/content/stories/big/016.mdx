I was <u>excited</u> to play in my first baseball game. I had been <u>training</u> with my <u>team</u> for weeks. I was the <u>catcher</u> and had to catch the ball when the <u>pitcher</u> threw it. I was <u>feeling</u> ready to play my best.

The game <u>started</u> and I was <u>sitting</u> behind home plate. The first <u>batter</u> came up to hit. The <u>pitcher</u> threw the ball and I caught it. The <u>batter</u> missed and it was a strike. I was <u>doing</u> a good job <u>catching</u> the ball.

When it was my turn to bat, I was a little scared. I had been <u>training</u> hard to hit the ball well. The <u>pitcher</u> threw the ball and I swung my bat. I hit the ball and it went far! I ran to first base as fast as I could.

My <u>team</u> won the game and we were all very happy. I had played well as the <u>catcher</u> and even got a hit. My mom and dad were proud of how I played. I could not wait to play more baseball games with my <u>team</u>!
