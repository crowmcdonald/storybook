I wanted to learn how to pitch the ball in baseball. My dad was <u>helping</u> me learn in our back yard. He was <u>teaching</u> me how to hold the ball and how to throw it. I was <u>trying</u> to get the ball to go where I wanted.

At first, my throws were not very good. The ball would go too high or too low. My dad said I needed to keep <u>trying</u> and not give up. He showed me how to step and throw the ball the right way.

<u>After</u> many days of <u>training</u>, I was <u>getting</u> better. My throws were <u>going</u> right to my dad's glove. I was <u>feeling</u> proud of how much I had learned. <u>Throwing</u> the ball was <u>getting</u> easier and easier.

Now I am the <u>pitcher</u> on my baseball <u>team</u>. I can throw the ball fast and right where I want. My <u>team</u> is proud of how well I can pitch. All that <u>training</u> with my dad really helped me <u>become</u> a good <u>pitcher</u>!
