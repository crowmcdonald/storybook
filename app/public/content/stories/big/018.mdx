I was <u>excited</u> to try my first Jiu Jitsu class. I had seen people <u>doing</u> it on TV and it looked fun. The <u>teacher</u> showed us how to bow and be nice to each other. We all had to wear a white suit <u>called</u> a gi.

The <u>teacher</u> <u>started</u> by <u>teaching</u> us how to fall down safely. We had to roll on the mat <u>without</u> <u>getting</u> hurt. At first it was hard but I kept <u>trying</u>. <u>Rolling</u> on the mat was fun once I learned how to do it right.

Then we learned how to grab each other's arms and legs. The <u>teacher</u> showed us moves that could help us get away if someone grabbed us. We were <u>training</u> with <u>partners</u> and <u>helping</u> each other learn. It was hard work but very fun.

<u>After</u> class, I felt tired but happy. I had learned so many new things. The <u>teacher</u> said I did well for my first day. I could not wait to come back and learn more Jiu Jitsu moves!
