I had been <u>training</u> Jiu Jitsu for many months. My <u>teacher</u> said I was ready to test for my first belt. I was <u>excited</u> but also scared. I had been <u>working</u> hard to learn all the moves for the test.

On test day, I had to show all the moves I had learned. I did my rolls and showed how to get away from grabs. The <u>teacher</u> was <u>watching</u> me do each move. I was <u>trying</u> my best to do them all right.

The <u>teacher</u> also made me do moves with a <u>partner</u>. We had to show we could be safe and not hurt each other. My <u>partner</u> and I did all our moves <u>slowly</u> and with care. The <u>teacher</u> said we did very well.

At the end of the test, the <u>teacher</u> gave me my first belt! It was yellow and I was so proud. All my hard <u>training</u> had paid off. I could not wait to keep <u>learning</u> and get my next belt!
