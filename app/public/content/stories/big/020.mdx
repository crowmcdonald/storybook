I was <u>excited</u> to start my Pokemon trip. I had my first Pokemon with me and we were ready to go. We were <u>walking</u> down the road <u>looking</u> for new Pokemon to find. My Pokemon was small and cute with yellow fur.

We came to a forest where many Pokemon lived. I could hear them <u>calling</u> to each other in the trees. My Pokemon was <u>excited</u> to meet new <u>friends</u>. We walked into the forest to see what we could find.

We found a blue Pokemon by a small pond. It was <u>drinking</u> water and <u>looked</u> up when it saw us. My Pokemon ran over to say hello. The blue Pokemon was nice and wanted to play with us. They became <u>friends</u> right away.

I caught the blue Pokemon and now I had two <u>friends</u> with me. We kept <u>walking</u> and found many more Pokemon. Each one was <u>different</u> and had special powers. I was <u>having</u> the best Pokemon adventure ever with all my new <u>friends</u>!
