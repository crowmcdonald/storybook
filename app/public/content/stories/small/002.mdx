A <u>boy</u> did <u>mine</u> <u>deep</u> in the <u>dark</u> <u>cave</u>. He <u>found</u> <u>iron</u> in the <u>rock</u>. He <u>took</u> the <u>iron</u> to his <u>home</u> <u>base</u>. He <u>put</u> it in the <u>hot</u> <u>fire</u> to <u>make</u> a <u>tool</u>.

<u>With</u> the <u>hot</u> <u>iron</u>, the <u>boy</u> did <u>make</u> a <u>new</u> <u>sword</u>. It was <u>long</u> and <u>sharp</u> and <u>cold</u>. He <u>held</u> it <u>up</u> to the <u>light</u>. He <u>felt</u> <u>strong</u> and <u>ready</u> to <u>fight</u>.
